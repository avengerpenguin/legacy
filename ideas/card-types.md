# Card Types

## Growth Deck

* Item -- things you might find or trivially buy from local shops. Everything
is free or low cost.
* Event -- turned face up immediately and resolved. Normally two outcomes with
either the player choosing between them or one outcome only being triggered if
a player has a sufficient level for a certain trait.
* Person -- play this to bring a person into your sphere of control --
this could be an employee, a person loyal to you etc.


## Legacy Deck

* Opportunity -- A special kind of event card that stays in play. This
  is normally an event that changes the world significantly and can
  affect all players. A player will have to ensure one of these is in
  play before they can make a move on their secret agenda.
* Secret Agenda -- A card a player will play that will change their
  role or position in the game permanently. These normally require a
  certain level of traits are revealed to play them rather than
  allowing you to afford the card by trait bonuses already
  face-up. This represents the need for an element of surprise to play
  these cards.
* Legacy -- This is the winning card of the game. A player may play
  any one of these provided 1) they can afford it, 2) any prerequisite
  Secret Agenda and Opportunity cards are in play.
