# Card Types

## Deck 1

* Item -- things you might find or trivially buy from local shops. Everything
is free or low cost.
* Event -- turned face up immediately and resolved. Normally two outcomes with
either the player choosing between them or one outcome only being triggered if
a player has a sufficient level for a certain trait.
