# Card Types

## Starter Deck

The first deck generally has no negative consequences
for players, but has cards with the lowest trait bonuses.

Cards may have two choices

* **Item** -- things you might find or trivially buy from local shops. Everything
is free or low cost.
* **Event** -- turned face up immediately and resolved. Normally two outcomes with
either the player choosing between them or one outcome only being triggered if
a player has a sufficient level for a certain trait.


## Growth Deck

The second deck gives bigger rewards than the first, but many of the cards
have negative consequences for players not strong enough in traits.

* **Building** -- play this to buy or build a particular building. These can
 give large bonuses and will have abilities you can trigger.
* **Person** -- play this to bring a person into your sphere of control --
this could be an employee, a person loyal to you etc. Some people need a
particular building to work in.
* **Premium Item** -- these behave like normal items, but are much higher
in terms of bonuses.
* **Challenge** -- these are event cards that have either a positive or
negative outcome. If you have a sufficient level of any traits required by
the challenge, you will come out with a strong bonus. If you cannot meet
the required levels, some negative consequence must be played out.
* **Experience** -- these are things you choose to do or go through to come
out stronger afterwards.

## Legacy Deck

* **Opportunity** -- A special kind of event card that stays in play. This
  is normally an event that changes the world significantly and can
  affect all players. A player will have to ensure one of these is in
  play before they can make a move on their secret agenda.
* **Secret Agenda** -- A card a player will play that will change their
  role or position in the game permanently. These normally require a
  certain level of traits are revealed to play them rather than
  allowing you to afford the card by trait bonuses already
  face-up. This represents the need for an element of surprise to play
  these cards.
* **Legacy** -- This is the winning card of the game. A player may play
  any one of these provided 1) they can afford it, 2) any prerequisite
  Secret Agenda and Opportunity cards are in play.
