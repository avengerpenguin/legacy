# Game Concepts

The idea here is to create a common glossary of all the terms/concepts. This
is a draft at the moment.

## Cards

The game is simply three card decks in front of all players. Players choose
which to draw from based on how developed they think their character is. Cards
are kept in hands unless they say you must resolve them as you draw them.

When a player plays a card, it might be to discard it for a one-off benefit
that lasts for their turn only or it may be placed in front of them to give
a continuous benefit throughout the rest of the game (or until they must 
remove it for any reason).

Cards played in front of players may be placed face-up or face-down.

## Traits

A *Trait* is one of six attributes a character can have. All players start with
level 0 on each Trait and the level is boosted through items, events, etc.

List of traits:

* Strength -- Your physical might whether your own strength or because of
having soldiers fighting for you.
* Magic -- Your ability and command over spells, magical items, etc.
* Shadow -- Your connection to the darker side of society or magic. This could
be crime connections or ability with dark magic.
* Knowledge -- Your scientific knowledge and artistic talent combined. A high
level here indicates high intelligence.
* Wealth -- Your general wealth level relates to things like net worth, income,
etc. so this is not a cash pool that is depleted. A high level here represents
your ability to buy things as and when you need them.
* Influence -- Your political capital and general level of fame and popularity.
How likely people are to do things for you without coercion or bribery.s

All of these levels are fixed indications of your ability in each area. It is
arguably simpler to represent wealth as just a level you obtain and not
complicate things further by also having a gold reserve.

### Demeanor

Any trait boosted by cards you play face-up in front of you form part of your
character's public demeanor. For example, someone who clearly demonstrates
strength, wins tournaments and shows high skill with weapons is starting to
present the public image of a warrior.

### Agenda

A player may equally choose to play any card *face-down* in front of them
instead of face-up. Doing so forms a *secret* side to your character known
as your *agenda*.

These cards do not provide a level boost while face-down, but a player may
*at any time* turn one or more of these cards face up to receive the boost to
their public traits (say in reaction to an event that requires a sudden
boost to a trait in order to avoid a negative outcome).

Any cards revealed in this way must remain face up for the rest of the game.
This prevents their use to play a secret agenda action later as your having
to expose that side of you has undermined its secret nature.

For example, a player is building up a wealth secretly to fund a hidden
project, but they are forced to reveal their wealth to make emergency repairs
to some damaged buildings. The sudden revelation of secret wealth raises lots
of questions and causes more attention from tax collectors rivals' spies, which
ultimately makes the project more expensive to keep secret. The player needs to
accumulate even more secret wealth to see the project to completion.

As part of establishing your legacy and winning the game, you will normally
be required to play an *Agenda Action* card. These cards are likely to require
that the necessary trait level is revealed only at the moment you play that
card, so players will want to ensure they need some character traits hidden.

## Role

A role is like a classic character class, but is earned once you have mastered
a trait enough to justify people use that label to describe you.

Events in the game can trigger a player being promoted from an everyday person
to a recognised role in the world. There is normally a requirement of
having mastered a trait to a particular level by the time the event happens.

Any player that meets the requirement to earn a role may take a role card and
place it in front of them.

For example, the *Grand Tournament* card declares that the player with the
highest Strength trait is named the undefeated champion Warrior of the realm.
If this event card is revealed, that player may place a *Warrior* role card
in front of them and for the rest of the game is known as a warrior (cards
that have effects on warriors will now apply to them).
